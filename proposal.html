            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p> We aim to develop a comprehensive platform facilitating easy access to part-time
                 job opportunities within the local community. 
                This application, akin to platforms like LinkedIn or Handshake, will empower users
                 to efficiently search, categorize job listings, communicate directly with employers, 
                and submit applications. Additionally, users can maintain a profile account, providing 
                detailed information to foster meaningful connections with potential employers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the presence of existing job-seeking applications, the majority of 
                traditional part-time job opportunities still rely on conventional methods like word of mouth, 
                physical flyers, or local social media pages. The proposed platform seeks to address 
                this gap by creating a centralized space that effectively connects individuals, particularly students,
                 with local businesses. While platforms like Indeed offer job search functionalities,
                  they often fall short in representing many small businesses, possibly due to associated posting fees. 
                 Furthermore, Indeed lacks a comprehensive profile feed similar to LinkedIn, limiting the 
                 ability to showcase detailed information about individuals and their professional portfolios.
